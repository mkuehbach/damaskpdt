	damaskpdt --- the DAMASK parallelized property distribution tracker --- is an MPI/OpenMP/SIMD-
	parallelized tool for datamining the spatial distribution of state variable values at interfaces
	which evolve during straining in 3d full-field crystal plasticity simulations.

	It supplements the python post-processing routines of the DAMASK crystal plasticity solver
	package <https://damask.mpie.de/>. The novelty is the rigorous parallel and locality-aware
	spatial-distributed storing of snapshot data to make the processing of terabyte-scale
	crystal plasticity simulation snapshot data efficient, scalable.

	This enables to study and quantify distributional trends, which other techniques and
	analysis workflows have so far not practically been able to process.

	The source code was developed by Markus K\"uhbach during his postdoc with the Max-Planck-Institut f\"ur
	Eisenforschung GmbH in D\"usseldorf for the purpose of quantifying the potential accumulation of dislocation
	density, stresses, and strain in front of interfaces. The model implements a distance based approach
