# damaskpdt
Additional post-processing functionality for DAMASK (the DÃ¼sseldorf Advanced MAterial Simulation Kit) focusing on characterizing the spatial distribution of state variable values as a function of the integration point distance to interfaces.

# Dependencies:
C/C++ compiler, C2011 spec capable, e.g. GNU or Intel compiler
Message Passing Library (MPI), MPIThreadFunneled capable, e.g. Intel MPI, MPICH 
Intel Math Kernel Library v2018.4
Boost C/C++ header libraries v1.66
Hierarchical data format library HDF5 v1.10.2

# Prepare code compilation:
1.) Check existence and correct installation of all dependencies
2.) Establish your shell environment variable, most convenientlyu through loading above dependencies via module environment
3.) Modify upper section of the CMakeLists.txt to change path of your specific library locations.
Be care
4.) Go into the damaskpdt build folder

# Compile the code:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make

# Prepare an analysis:
0.) damaskpdt uses relative paths. 
1.) Make sure a spectralOut file and its associated small meta files *.outputConstitutive, *.outputHomogenization, *.outputCrystallite exist.
2.) Set quantities and analysis tasks in the *.xml settings files. An example is in the build folder.
3.) Set your environment for OpenMP multithreading:
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=x
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
export OMP_PLACES=cores
x should be the number of threads you want to use. Do not use two threads per hyperthreading core it makes in most
cases no sense. Feel free to contact me for advise.
Linear algebra operations on material points are threaded with OpenMP already.
Therefore do not use more than one thread for the Intel MKL library as otherwise too many threads/tasks will be create
resulting in too much overhead.

# Run an analysis:
export simid=y
damaskpdt $simid Settings.xml MySpectralOut 1>DAMASKPDT.SimID.$simid.STDOUT.txt 2>DAMASKPDT.SimID.$simid.STDERR.txt

y is here an unsigned integer to distinguish results from different runs
Settings.xml is the name of your specific settings file
MySpectralOut is the name of your spectralOut file, do not add the extension *.spectralOut file, it will be added automatically!
